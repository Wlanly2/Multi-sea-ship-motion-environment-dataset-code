# Multi-sea-ship-motion-environment-dataset-code
This file involves the code for processing AIS data and environmental data of each sea area, as well as the extraction module and secondary optimization filtering code. Through the above processing, the final multi-sea ship environment dataset can be obtained. Due to the file upload size limit, only the code and the Houston waters dataset are provided here. We have processed the dataset. You can find the dataset content of other sea areas at the following URL: https://github.com/Wlanly/Multi-sea-ship-motion-environment-dataset-model/tree/master

The Houston maritime area is primarily known for its port operations, particularly through the Houston Ship Channel, one of the busiest maritime passages globally. Official data indicates that Port Houston manages and operates eight public terminals along the 52-mile waterway, including the largest bulk cargo facility and two highly efficient container terminals. Economic impact studies reveal that in 2022, the Houston Ship Channel contributed $906 billion to the U.S. economy, supporting over 3.4 million jobs, with 1.5 million in Texas. This highlights its main economic activities centered around port operations such as container handling, bulk cargo transportation, and automobile import and export. Historical records further support this classification, showing that since its opening in 1914, the channel's primary function has been to facilitate international trade.

The San Francisco maritime area is renowned for its diverse shipping activities, including cargo transport, cruise services, and ferry operations, reflecting its comprehensive shipping characteristics. The Port of San Francisco manages a 7.5-mile waterfront area from the Golden Gate Bridge anchorage to Candlestick Point, handling various types of cargo such as automobiles, dry bulk, and construction materials, while also supporting ferry services for tourists and commuters. Historical research indicates that during World War II, the San Francisco port served as a Pacific military logistics hub, handling troop and material transport, showcasing its multifunctionality. Recent data and port reports further confirm its integrated role in international trade and local transportation, such as processing automobile imports at Pier 80 and dry bulk at Piers 92 and 94.

The San Juan Islands maritime area is predominantly focused on tourism-related shipping, mainly through the Washington State Ferry and other small vessel services catering to tourists. Travel guides and local resources emphasize its role as a tourist destination, attracting visitors for whale watching, kayaking, and scenic tours. The San Juan Islands Visitors Bureau provides detailed transportation and activity information, showing that ferries are the primary mode of transport, supporting tourists traveling from Anacortes to San Juan Island, Orcas Island, and Lopez Island. Travel books like Marge and Ted Mueller's "The San Juan Islands (Afoot & Afloat)" extensively describe boating and leisure activities, highlighting its tourism-oriented shipping nature. Historical studies indicate that since the post-World War II tourism boom, ferry services have been a vital component of the islands' economy.
