# Multi-sea-ship-motion-environment-dataset-code
This file involves the code for processing AIS data and environmental data of each sea area, as well as the extraction module and secondary optimization filtering code. Through the above processing, the final multi-sea ship environment dataset can be obtained. Due to the file upload size limit, only the code and the Houston waters dataset are provided here. We have processed the dataset. You can find the dataset content of other sea areas at the following URL: https://github.com/Wlanly/Multi-sea-ship-motion-environment-dataset-model/tree/master
