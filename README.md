# Multi-sea-ship-motion-environment-dataset-code
This file involves the code for processing AIS data and environmental data of various sea areas, as well as extraction modules and secondary optimization filtering codes. Through the above processing, the final multi-sea area ship-environmental data set can be obtained
Due to file size limitations, only the code is provided here. We have already processed the dataset, and you can find the dataset part at the following URL: https://github.com/Wlanly/Multi-sea-ship-motion-environment-dataset-model/tree/master
